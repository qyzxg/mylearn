If you want to know whether a particular application, or a library
with particular functionality, is available in Python there are a
number of possible sources of information. The Python web site
provides a Python Package Index (also known as the Cheese Shop,
a reference to the Monty Python script of that name). There is
also a search page for a number of sources of Python-related
information. Failing that, just Google for a phrase including the
word ''python121'' and you may well get the result you need. If all
else fails, ask1 on the python newsgroup and there's a good chance
someone will put you on the right track qq 541020238 , tel 13888838388
